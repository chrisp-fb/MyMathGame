# Demonstration of Facebook SDK for iOS v4.0
This was the demo used in the talk I gave for the Seattle iOS Meetup group in May 2015.

The initial comment contains the contrived app : a single table view listing the unlocked levels of an arithmetic math game.

# Facebook Integration
1. FBSDKCoreKit: [App Events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/ios) to log app activations and what level the user gets to.
2. FBSDKShareKit: [App Invites](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-invites/ios), [Photo Sharing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/ios), and the [Like Button](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/ios#buttons). Thanks to thecatapi.com for random imagery.
3. FBSDKLoginKit: [Login with Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios/v2.3).

# To Use
Since this is an unpublished the app, the FacebookAppID is restricted to developers of the app. If you want to exercise the app with your own Facebook account, create a new Facebook App and use your own App ID in the plist.
